# 100 Days Python Challenge/Playtime

Welcome to the 100 Days Python Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you go from a beginner to an expert in Python programming over the course of 100 days. Whether you are new to coding or looking to expand your Python skills, this challenge will provide you with daily tasks and resources to guide your learning journey.

## How to Participate

*Commitment*: Dedicate at least 1 hour every day for the next 100 days to complete the tasks and exercises.
*Setup*: Make sure you have Python and an integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your computer. You can use any IDE of your choice, such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook.
*Resources*: Utilize online Python tutorials, documentation, and other learning materials to support your learning throughout the challenge. Some recommended resources include:
- Python.org - The official Python website
- Python Documentation - Official Python documentation
- Online tutorials and courses (e.g., Codecademy, Coursera, Udemy, etc.)
- Programming books (e.g., "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, etc.)
*Daily Tasks*: Each day, a new coding task will be provided for you to complete. These tasks are designed to reinforce key Python concepts and build upon each other as you progress. Feel free to explore additional topics and exercises beyond the provided tasks to further enhance your skills.
*GitHub Repository*: Maintain a GitHub repository to track your progress throughout the challenge. Commit and push your code regularly, and use the repository as a journal to document your learnings, challenges faced, and solutions.

## Daily Task Structure

* Each daily task will follow a similar structure:


*Task Description*: A brief explanation of the concept or problem you are expected to work on that day.
*Resources*: Relevant resources and documentation links to help you understand the concept or problem.
*Task*: Your coding task for the day.
*Solution*: A solution to the task will be provided the day after to compare and learn from your approach.

## Guidelines and Tips

*Code Review*: Occasionally seek feedback on your code from fellow developers or online coding communities. This will help you improve your programming practices and gain different perspectives.
*Experiment and Modify*: Don't shy away from experimenting and modifying the provided tasks. Try different approaches, solve additional problems, and build your projects to further apply what you've learned.
*Ask for Help*: If you get stuck on a particular task, don't hesitate to ask for assistance from online forums, communities, or Stack Overflow.
*Take Breaks*: Learning programming can be mentally taxing. Take breaks when needed, but make sure to stay consistent and complete the daily tasks.
*Document Your Progress*: Keep a journal or notes on what you have learned, challenges you've faced, and any new tricks or insights you've gained along the way. This will be valuable for future reference.

## Resources

In addition to the daily tasks, here are some recommended resources to enhance your Python learning:


- Python.org
- Python Documentation
- Codecademy Python Course
- Coursera Python Courses
- Udemy Python Courses

Now that you're equipped with the instructions and resources, get ready to embark on an exciting 100-day journey of learning Python! Remember, practice, consistency, and dedication are key to becoming an expert programmer. Good luck!
